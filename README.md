# HotCorner Pro


![HotCorner Pro Icon](/public/icon.png "HotCorner Pro Icon")

HotCorner Pro is an open source extension to assign quick mouse shortcuts to each corner of a webpage.

Sometime it is just a bit easier to double click to get desired actions.

With this extension, you can allocate certain areas of a webpage for such shortcuts. It comes with many useful predefined ones:

- Scroll to page top
- Scroll to page bottom
- Toggle page wide blur
- Make page greyscale
- Reload page
- Go back
- Go forward.

And many more to come. If you have any requests, feel free to contact me dev@faisalbin.com

HotCorner Pro is made with love in Munich.

To start, clone the project and run `npm install` to install all dependencies. Finally, run `npm build` to run the app. This command should build/bundle everything in the `dist` folder.

From Chrome/Microsoft Edge, go to Extensions page, turn on Developer Mode, and then load unpacked. Select the dist folder as the source of the extension, this should install the app in the browser.

Try editing the `src/Action.tsx` or other files and see the changes reflect automatically.

Feedback/Discussions and pull requests are welcome. :)
